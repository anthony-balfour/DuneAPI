Created a Dune Book Series API using Node, Express for use with AJAX and fetch.
Has 2 endpoints:
  -One for the dune book series
  -One for a contact me form submission
  
Contact Me form that serves a message based on if the client input is correct (does not actually send email currently)
Uses the Node File System (fs) to serve information based on selected book on the webpage.
